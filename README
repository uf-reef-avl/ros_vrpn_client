Installation
------------

This installation assumes you have ROS installed and created a catkin workspace on your computer

1. In the command terminal, move to your catkin workspace's src directory (cd catkin_ws/src)

2. Once inside the catkin src directory type: git clone http://10.251.72.180/Pathfinder4/ros_vrpn_client
	and enter in your GitLab credentials when prompted

3. Either move back out of your catkin src directory to use catkin_make or run catkin_build (ignore the warnings)

4. Once done you can begin to use vrpn node with motive and optitrack


Important notes before running
---------------

-Make sure your computer is on the pathfinder or pathfinder5 network

-Have your robot's rigid body created and tracked in the motive/optitrack system

-The default frames are North East Down (NED) and North West Up (NWU)


-Location messages are in the form of:

	geometry_msg/TransformedStamped (/robotrigidbody/ned or nwu/pose)

	and

	geometry_msg/PoseStampted (/robotrigidbody/ned or nwu/pose_stamped)

	where robotrigidbody is the name of the robot's rigid body set in motive or optitrack.

	To see them when the vrpn client is active type: rostopic list


Running the code
----------------


-To run vrpn from the command line type: roslaunch ros_vrpn_client test.launch name:=robotrigidbody
	where robotrigidbody is the name of the robot's rigid body set in motive or optitrack.
	
-To run vrpn from within a launch file add:

	<include file = "$(find ros_vrpn_client)/launch/test.launch">
    <arg name = "name" value="$(robotrigidbody)"/>
	</include>
